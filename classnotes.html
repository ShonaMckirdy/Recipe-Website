<!-- bootstrapping -->
<!-- This is designed to make designing a website easier by doing a lot of the grunt work for you -->
<!-- such as making responsiveness for you -->

<!-- bootstrap is built off of the fact that we want our websites to be mobile friendly first, and then from there, everything else should be build for the other devices up to a monitor screen -->
<!-- bootstrap sorts this out for us -->

<!-- how does it do this? responsive breakpoints -->
<!-- we start out with a container containing some pre-written code -->
<!-- we are just downloading and using this pre-written code -->
<!-- however this means we should know the class and id names -->

<!-- a container is a fancy divs which wraps some elements of a web page. This allows our containers to be more flexible. Inside the container we can define a grid -->
<!-- have a look on bootstrap and all of the different functions it offers -->
